# YOLO (v3) in MxNetR

This is a simple example for implementing the YOLO (v3) Net by MxNetR. The idea is devoloped by Joseph Chet Redmon, and related details can be found in his [website](Joseph Chet Redmon). 

This is a simple example for MxNetR user, I will use a relatively small dataset for demonstrating hot it work. The Pascal VOC challenge is a very popular dataset for building and evaluating algorithms for image classification, object detection, and segmentation. I will use the mirror website for downloading *VOC2007* dataset. You can use the code ["1. download VOC2007.R"](https://github.com/xup6fup/MxNetR-YOLO/code/1.%20download%20VOC2007.R) to quickly download this dataset.
